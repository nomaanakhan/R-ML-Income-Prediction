# R-ML-Income-Prediction
In this project I try predict whether a person earns more or less than $50,000 based on various factors using various ML techniques.
This is a data set of census data compiled by the Census Bureau of the United States.

First I establish a baseline using Naive Bayes. Accuracy: 0.8264234384

Then I use Decision Trees. Accuracy: 0.8445427185
Pruned Tree accuracy: 0.8445427185.

Then I use Neural Networks. Accuracy: 0.763773724
